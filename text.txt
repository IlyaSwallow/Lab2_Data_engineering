 I thought I could not do. I have to give you anything you ask. They've known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to the Council of Help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee. Even though my wife was Godmother to you, Rony Child. But let's be frank, yeah. You never wanted my friendship. And, uh, you weren't afraid to be my dad. I didn't want to get into trouble. Oh, you understand? You found paradise in America. I had a good trade, made a good living, please protect the junior records of law. He didn't need a family. But now you come to me and you say, I'm currently only giving justice. It's your last one to respect me. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. You said you'd come into my house on the day my daughter was to be married and you asked me to murder. Money. I ask you for justice. That is not justice your daughter is still alive. Look at her, she's suffering. She suffers. How much shall I pay you? Bono sera, bono sera. Whatever I have done to make you treat me so disrespectful, He had come to me in friendship. And this come that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then he would become my enemies. And then they will fear you. Be my friend. Got the father. Good. Someday, I'm up there, they may never come. I'll call upon you to do a service. Until that day, accept this justice as a gift that might not as well end it. Grazie. Grazie. Grazie. Bye.
